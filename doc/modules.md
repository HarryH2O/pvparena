> Community modules are not officially supported. Please test them thoroughly in your environment.

**Key :** ✔️️ Optimized (even rewritten) and fully tested for 2.0 | ❌ Temporarily unavailable

> ℹ **NB:** StandardLounge, StandardSpectate, QuickLounge, BattlefieldJoin and WarmupJoin are bundled in the plugin. Consequently, they're missing from the modules pack.

### Why are there different statuses?

PVP Arena exists since 2011 and Minecraft servers evolution make modules follow-up complicated. The objective of 2.0 
version was to make a great check-up of all of them, fix their issues and make them more performant and easy-to-use.

Unfortunately, rewriting modules is a long and tedious task, and maintaining two versions of PVPArena and two versions 
of each module became too complicated. That's why I decided to focus on most-used modules and on the release of the 2.0
version of the plugin.

Anyway, the unavailable modules will come back soon, just the time to fix (or rewrite them).

### What happened to BattlefieldManager and Items?
The modules have been renamed to SpawnCollections and ItemSpawners respectively.

### What happened to other missing modules?

As you maybe saw it, several modules has been removed. They are ArenaBoards, AutoSneak, AutoVote, BattlefieldGuard, 
Factions, FixInventoryLoss, MatchResultsStats, RedstoneTriggers, SinglePlayerSupport, SpecialJoin and WorldGuard.

These modules either used discontinued features (like arena rounds) or their features have been integrated in core of
PVPArena plugin.

## Installing modules

### Download the module pack

> ℹ This has to be done only once
 
Use the [`/pa modules download`](commands/modules.md) command to download the release version of modules. If you want to
install a dev build version, download the zip archive directly on our [discord](https://discord.gg/a8NhSsXKVQ) 
and deflate it in the `/files` directory of pvparena.

After this step, if you type [`/pa modules list`](commands/modules.md), you will show the list of all installable 
modules.

### Installing a module

> ℹ This has to be done for each module you want to install

Modules aren't loaded by default, a quick installation is required. 
Type [`/pa modules install <moduleName>`](commands/modules.md) to install one of them.


### Enable a module for an arena

> ℹ This has to be done for each arena

Last step: your module is installed, and you want to use it in some of your arenas. 
Type [`/pa <arena> !tm <moduleName>`](commands/togglemod.md) to enable it in your arena.

<br>

## Updating modules

### With latest release version

Just run [`/pa modules upgrade`](commands/modules.md). In some cases, a server restart may be needed.

### With a snapshot/dev version

Browse the `plugins/pvparena` directory. Delete the `files` folder and unzip the new modules archive.  
Then type [`/pa modules update`](commands/modules.md). In some cases, a server restart may be needed.
